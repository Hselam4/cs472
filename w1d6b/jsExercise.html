    <b>4. What is "Unobtrusive Javascript"? What is the practical application of Unobtrusive Javascript (and the reasons
for using it)?</b>
</pre>
<pre>
    <b>Answer:</b>
 Unobtrusive Javascript is used to write javascript as a separate file from HTML file or 
documentation.
and the practical application of Unobtrusive Javascript (and the reasons for using it) promotes separation of web page content 
into three different concerns which are content (HTML), presentation (CSS), and 
behavior(JS). We don’t need to write JS code inside HTML.
Main reason is the sepration of concepts:content (html), presentation (css) and behavior (js).
    -It is using for separation of HTML and JS usages. For example, when we define a buttons onclick action outside of html tag
     scope this will be unobtrusive usage. This concept is using for code separation, clean global scope and usability improvement.
